# Internet of Things Projects
  This repository contains all the projects that i have worked on. The projects includes the use of 
  several Microcontrollers like Arduino, Node MCU and also Single board computers i.e those which
  are neither Microcontroller nor Microprocessor like Raspberry Pi for and they helped me to get 
  a major experience in the field of IOT.

### Disclaimer
    They include both opensource (whose credits are given in the readme description file) 
    & my own projects which are implemented and executed and their test values are uploaded
    in the repository.
