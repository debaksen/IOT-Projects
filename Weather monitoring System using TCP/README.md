# TCP BASED WEATHER MONITORING SYSTEM USING DHT11 SENSOR USING MDNS


### Introduction : 

TCP is connection oriented (Transmission Control Protocol) i.e. TCP tracks all data sent, it requires acknowledgment for each process of the connection stages (octet).Because of this TCP is considered TCP is considered more reliable transfer protocol unlike UDP where it sends
the information randomly without any acknowledgment from the other side. Here in this project we will build a weather monitoring system based upon TCP connection that will create a local server dedicated to a certain ip in which the device (Node MCU) has been connected to.

We will also use MDNS i.e. Multicaste domain name system tha will give our local ip a user friendly name (default esp8266.local) from which
we can access our server securely.
